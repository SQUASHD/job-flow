## About

This project is an experiment in combining React Server Components in NextJS
with a purely local SQLite database. This combination aims to create a
responsive, user-friendly interface with efficient data handling, ideal for
managing and tracking job applications.

## Roadmap
- [ ] Track job applications/openings
  - Add job applications by simply pasting a URL
- [ ] Sorting/organizing job openings
  - Using Tanstack Table for a flexible and interactive table
- [ ] Sankey Diagram
  - Visualisation of the job hunt, because who doesn't love metrics?

## Possible Features

I have not investigated the feasibility of any of these features, so this can
be considered purely spitballing possible features to implement

- [ ] Integrate AI to make tailored non-generic job applications
  - Customizing applications based on project descriptions and job requirements.
- [ ] Notifications
  - Exploring email or push notifications; requires a live service backend.
- [ ] Connect to job board APIs
  - Investigating the availability and integration of job board APIs

## Contribution

The project is currently not open for contributions as I focus on developing
the MVP. Future collaboration opportunities will be announced as the project evolves.
